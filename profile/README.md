# Introduction to the Cellular-Nanoscience-Group GitHub Organisation
#### Hi everybody 👋
Welcome to the Cellular-Nanoscience-Group GitHub organisation! 
<br>This is where we collaborate on code, data analysis, and other computational tools for our various research projects and setups.
The purpose of this platform is to transform our current code chaos into a structured form with better version control, 
so please take a minute to familiarise yourself with GitHub and try your best to keep order in the individual repositories.
<br><br>Here's a first little tip: For every little difficulty in using GitHub, ChatGPT is always ready to guide you through it step by step :)
<br><br>This document explains the basic structure and functions of our organisation and the rules to ensure smooth collaboration. 

## Organisation structure 
Each setup has its own repository: 
- **Shenlong** 
- **Gleipnir** 
- **ASWAD** 
- **Skadi**
- **Aalo**

In addition, the repository **General** is intended for all scripts or data analysis-related files used across different setups (for example, PyOTic for all optical tweezers)
or that would be useful for other lab members independent of their project (feel free to share your ideas!).
<br>**.github** is a special repository immediately visible to all members of the GitHub organisation. It will contain information on how to use this platform.
<br>In general, everybody here has at least write permission, so you can not only download or update code but also adjust/optimise the structure of repositories and folders over time.
