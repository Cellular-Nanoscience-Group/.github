# Introduction to the Cellular-Nanoscience-Group GitHub Organisation
#### Hi everybody ðŸ‘‹
Welcome to the Cellular-Nanoscience-Group GitHub organisation! 
<br>This is where we collaborate on code, data analysis, and other computational tools for our various research projects and setups.
The purpose of this platform is to transform our current code chaos into a structured form with better version control, 
so please take a minute to familiarise yourself with GitHub and try your best to keep order in the individual repositories.
<br><br>Here's a first little tip: For every little difficulty in using GitHub, ChatGPT is always ready to guide you through it step by step :)
<br><br>This document explains the basic structure and functions of our organisation and the rules to ensure smooth collaboration.
